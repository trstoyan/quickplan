```

### Manual Installation

```bash
go build -o quickplan
sudo mv quickplan /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Create a New Project

```bash
# Create a project with a specific name
quickplan create myproject

# Create using the --project flag
quickplan create --project work

# Create a default project
quickplan create
```

### List Projects

```bash
# List all available projects and current one
quickplan projects
```

### Switch Between Projects

```bash
# Show interactive menu to select project
quickplan change

# Switch directly to a project
quickplan change myproject
```

### Add Tasks

```bash
# Add to current project
quickplan add "Complete the feature documentation"

# Add to a specific project
quickplan add "Review pull request" --project work

# Multiple tasks
quickplan add "Task one"
quickplan add "Task two"
```

### Complete Tasks

```bash
# Mark a task as complete (interactive menu)
quickplan complete

# Complete specific task by ID
quickplan complete 1

# Complete task in specific project
quickplan complete 2 --project work

# Add a note when completing
quickplan complete 1 --note "Reviewed and approved"
```

### Delete Tasks

```bash
# Delete a task by ID (with confirmation)
quickplan delete 1

# Delete multiple tasks at once
quickplan delete 1 2 3

# Delete task in specific project
quickplan delete 3 --project work

# Force delete without confirmation
quickplan delete 2 --force
```

### Undo Deletion

```bash
# Restore tasks removed in the last delete command
quickplan undo
```

### List Tasks

```bash
# List incomplete tasks in current project
quickplan list

# List all tasks including completed (shows latest 5 completed at bottom)
quickplan list --all

# List tasks in a specific project
quickplan list --project work --all

# List tasks from all projects
quickplan list --all-projects

# List all tasks from all projects (including all completed)
quickplan list --all-projects --all
```

### Archive Projects

```bash
# Archive the current project
quickplan archive

# Archive a specific project
quickplan archive old-project

# Unarchive (toggle off)
quickplan archive old-project
```

### Burndown Charts

```bash
# Display a text-based burndown chart for the current project
quickplan bdchart
```

Visualize task completion progress over time with a simple ASCII chart showing incomplete tasks per day.

### Ignore Patterns

QuickPlan automatically ignores certain directories like `.git` when listing projects. You can customize this behavior:

```bash
# Create a .quickplanignore file in ~/.local/share/quickplan/
# Add patterns (one per line, supports glob matching):
#
# .git
# temp
# backup-*
# test_*
```

Default ignored patterns:
- `.git` - Git repository directories
- `.*` - All hidden directories (starting with dot)
- `node_modules` - Node.js dependencies
- `build` - Build artifacts
- `.current_project` - QuickPlan's internal context file

### Project Management Summary

```bash
# See all projects
quickplan projects

# Switch to a project
quickplan change work

# Add tasks to current or specific project
quickplan add "Task description"
quickplan add "Task" --project work

# View tasks (incomplete only, latest 5 completed shown at bottom)
quickplan list

# View all tasks including completed
quickplan list --all

# View tasks from all projects
quickplan list --all-projects

# Complete tasks
quickplan complete 1

# Archive finished projects
quickplan archive old-project
```

The current project is stored in `~/.local/share/quickplan/.current_project`

## Project Structure

```
~/.local/share/quickplan/
├── .current_project          # Currently active project
├── .quickplanignore          # Custom ignore patterns (optional)
├── default/
│   ├── tasks.yaml           # Tasks for default project
│   └── project.yml          # Project configuration
├── work/
│   ├── tasks.yaml           # Tasks for work project
│   └── project.yml          # Project configuration
└── myproject/
    ├── tasks.yaml           # Tasks for myproject
    └── project.yml          # Project configuration
```

## File Formats

### tasks.yaml

Tasks are stored in YAML format with timestamps and version tracking:

```yaml
quickplan-cli-version: "0.1.0"
tasks:
  - id: 1
    text: "Complete the documentation"
    done: true
    created: 2025-11-03T13:07:12Z
    completed: 2025-11-03T14:30:00Z
  - id: 2
    text: "Review code changes"
    done: false
    created: 2025-11-03T13:08:00Z
created: 2025-11-03T13:07:12Z
modified: 2025-11-03T14:30:00Z
archived: false
```

### project.yml

Project configuration for future sync capabilities:

```yaml
name: "myproject"
description: "My awesome project"
sync_source:
  type: "local"  # Options: local, git, server
  url: ""        # For git: repo URL, for server: quickplan.sh URL
  branch: ""     # For git sources
created: 2025-11-03T13:07:12Z
modified: 2025-11-03T14:30:00Z
```

**Note:** The `sync_source` configuration prepares QuickPlan for future team collaboration features, allowing projects to sync from different sources (git repositories, quickplan.sh servers, etc.).
